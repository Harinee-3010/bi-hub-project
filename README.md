## ✨ Core Features

This application is divided into two main BI "engines," both powered by a hybrid AI architecture.

### 1. Customer Feedback Analyzer

* **File Upload:** Accepts `.pdf`, `.csv`, or `.xlsx` files containing raw customer feedback.
* **AI Summary:** Uses the Gemini AI to read the text and generate a concise summary of:
    * Overall Sentiment
    * Key Positive Themes
    * Areas for Improvement
* **Data Visualization:** Automatically generates a chart showing the distribution of positive, negative, and neutral feedback.

### 2. Retail Insight Engine

This is a multi-featured engine for analyzing structured (tabular) sales data.

* **💬 "Chat with Data" (RAG):**
    * A powerful, conversational chatbot that answers natural-language questions about your data.
    * **Multilingual:** Can understand and respond in mixed languages, including **Tanglish** (e.g., "Coimbatore-la sales evlo?").
    * **Safe & Hallucination-Proof:** Uses a "JSON-based RAG" architecture. The AI's job is to *only* translate a user's question into a safe JSON query, which is then executed by Python. This prevents AI hallucinations (like "39,975 customers") and code-injection attacks.
    * **User-Friendly:** The user does *not* need to know the exact column names. The AI is smart enough to find the correct columns or ask for clarification.

* **📊 "AI-Generated Dashboard"**
    * Acts as a "Senior Data Analyst" in a box.
    * The AI analyzes the file's schema and generates a JSON "plan" for 4-6 of the most insightful charts (e.g., "Sales by City," "Revenue by Category").
    * The frontend dynamically renders this plan into a full-page, PowerBI-style dashboard with a 2x2 grid of `line`, `bar`, and `pie` charts.

* **📈 "Sales Forecast Simulation"**
    * A true data science forecasting feature.
    * The AI intelligently identifies the date (`OrderMonth`, `OrderYear`) and sales (`Total Price`) columns from the user's file.
    * It pre-processes and resamples the data into monthly totals.
    * It trains a **SARIMA time-series model** to generate a 12-month sales forecast.
    * Displays the result in a beautiful chart showing "Historical vs. Forecasted" data, complete with a "cone of uncertainty."

### 3. Full-Stack Essentials

* **Full User Authentication:** Secure sign-up, login, and logout system.
* **File Management:** Users can only see and delete their own files.
* **Responsive Design:** A custom, professional "Deep Dive" dark theme built with Bootstrap 5.
