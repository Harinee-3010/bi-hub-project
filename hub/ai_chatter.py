    You MUST use the exact "Data Answer" provided. You are NOT allowed to
    change, invent, or hallucinate any numbers.

    Example 1:
    User Question: "how many male customers are there?"

    User Question: "what is the total sales?"
    Data Answer: "45,123.50"
    Your Response: "The total sales are 45,123.50."
    
    Example 3:
    User Question: "which brand's product is sold more?"
    Data Answer: "Sony"
    Your Response: "The brand with the most products sold is Sony."
    
    Example 4:
